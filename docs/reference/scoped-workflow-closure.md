## Workflow Context Inputs

`default-workflow` and workflow closure recipes pass these identity fields to
publish, readiness, final-status, and multitask monitor steps.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `repo_path` | path string | Yes | Repository root or worktree root for the current workflow. |
| `repository` | `owner/name` string | Required for GitHub PR scope | Exact GitHub repository. Resolved from `repo_path` when omitted and a GitHub remote exists. |
| `head_ref` or `branch` | string | Yes | Exact branch owned by the workflow. |
| `base_ref` | string | Required for PR scope | Exact PR target branch. |
| `pr_number` | integer or numeric string | Required when resuming a known PR | Existing pull request number. |
| `pr_url` | URL string | Optional with `pr_number` | Existing pull request URL. Must agree with `repository` and `pr_number`. |
| `issue_number` | integer or numeric string | Required when the workflow is issue-backed | GitHub issue expected in PR metadata or closing references. |
| `work_item_id` | string | Required when the workflow is work-item-backed | Non-GitHub work item expected in PR metadata. |
| `expected_pr_title_prefix` | string | Required for title-based candidate lookup | Prefix that newly created workflow PRs must use. |
| `created_after` | RFC 3339 timestamp | Recorded for tie-breaking | Workflow start time. Discards older candidates only when disambiguating multiple primary-key matches; never rejects the sole primary-key PR. |
| `head_sha` | full Git SHA | Required for readiness, final status, and exact-head no-op paths | PR head SHA that must match before scoped success is reported. |
| `recipe_run_id` | string | Required for multitask monitor authority | Unique recipe run id. |
| `tree_id` | string | Required for nested recipe authority | Recipe execution tree id. |
| `workstream_id` | string | Required for workstream authority | Logical workstream id. |

Known PR identity is authoritative when present. If `pr_number` or `pr_url` is
known, validators check that concrete PR first and fail closed on mismatch.

Scoped lookup without a known PR resolves against a **primary key** — the exact
tuple `repository + head_ref + base_ref` restricted to same-repository,
non-cross-repository PRs. GitHub permits only one OPEN pull request per
`head → base` within a repository, so this tuple already uniquely identifies the
workflow's own PR. When the primary key yields exactly one candidate, it is
adopted as current work without requiring any additional discriminator.

`issue_number`, `work_item_id`, `expected_pr_title_prefix`, `created_after`, and
`head_sha` are **tie-breakers**. They are applied only when the primary key
returns more than one candidate (for example, when open and closed PRs share the
same head and base). A tie-breaker narrows an ambiguous candidate set; it never
hard-rejects the sole primary-key candidate. If tie-breakers eliminate every
candidate but exactly one OPEN candidate exists, that OPEN candidate is adopted
rather than returning `no_scoped_pr`. OPEN candidates are always preferred over
closed candidates when state varies at any resolution step.

## Environment Inputs

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AMPLIHACK_HOME` | No | Overrides the framework bundle root used by recipe tools. |
| `AMPLIHACK_AGENT_BINARY` | No | Propagates the active agent binary to nested workflow agents. |

No environment variable disables scoped validation. If scope is incomplete, the
validator returns a named invalid result.

Operational runtime settings such as `NODE_OPTIONS` may be useful for large
nested runs, but they are not identity inputs and do not affect scoped
validation.

## Operation Requirements

| Operation | Required identity |
| --- | --- |
| Publish a new PR | `repository`, `head_ref`, `base_ref`, and `created_after`. `issue_number`, `work_item_id`, or `expected_pr_title_prefix` are recorded for tie-breaking and PR body linkage. |
| Update or resume a known PR | `pr_number` or `pr_url`, plus `repository`, `head_ref`, `base_ref`, and `created_after`. |
| Lookup a PR before identity is persisted | `repository`, `head_ref`, and `base_ref` (the primary key). Tracking discriminators are optional and used only to break ties. |
| Check readiness | Known PR identity plus `repository`, `head_ref`, `base_ref`, `created_after`, and `head_sha`. |
| Report final status | Known PR identity plus `repository`, `head_ref`, `base_ref`, `created_after`, and `head_sha`. |
| Validate a workstream process | `repo_path`, `workdir`, `branch`, `base_ref`, `recipe_run_id`, `tree_id`, `workstream_id`, `started_at`, `pid`, and process start metadata. |

The primary-key lookup (`repository + head_ref + base_ref`, same-repository) is
sufficient to identify the workflow's own PR because GitHub allows only one OPEN
PR per `head → base`. Tracking discriminators (`issue_number`, `work_item_id`,
`expected_pr_title_prefix`) and `head_sha` are tie-breakers for the rare case of
multiple candidates on the same head and base; they are not required to adopt a
unique candidate, and a stale or mismatched discriminator never rejects the sole
primary-key candidate.

## PR Scope Persistence

PR identity is passed through recipe context and publish outputs. Closure
recipes validate a persisted `pr_number` or `pr_url` first when either exists.

```json
{
  "pr_identity": {
    "repository": "rysweet/amplihack-rs",
    "number": 812,
    "url": "https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/pull/812",
    "head_ref": "feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "base_ref": "main",
    "issue_number": 754,
    "work_item_id": null,
    "expected_pr_title_prefix": "Fix issue #754:",
    "created_after": "2026-06-12T03:52:44Z",
    "head_sha": "6c8e3b2a4f2e55d0fb65d51d94d8f4c16f37a111",
    "captured_at": "2026-06-12T04:03:24Z"
  }
}
```

Precedence:

1. Validate persisted `number` and `url` when either exists (authoritative
   override — this short-circuits above the primary key).
2. If no concrete PR identity exists, resolve the primary key
   `repository + head_ref + base_ref` (same-repository, non-cross-repository).
   A single primary-key candidate is adopted directly.
3. If more than one primary-key candidate exists, apply tracking discriminators
   and `head_sha` as tie-breakers, preferring OPEN over closed. If tie-breakers
   eliminate all candidates but one OPEN candidate remains, adopt it.
4. Reject only genuine mismatches (different head branch, cross-repository, or an
   authoritative `pr_number`/`pr_url` that disagrees). Do not reject the sole
   primary-key candidate because a stale `issue_number` or `head_sha` no longer
   matches.
5. Persist the concrete PR identity immediately after publish succeeds.

## PR Scope Helper

`amplifier-bundle/tools/workflow_pr_scope.sh` is the only helper that determines
current-work PR identity for workflow closure.

```bash
amplifier-bundle/tools/workflow_pr_scope.sh \
  --repo rysweet/amplihack-rs \
  --head feat/issue-754-scoped-closure \
  --base main \
  --created-after 2026-06-12T03:52:44Z \
  --issue 754 \
  --expected-pr-title-prefix "Fix issue #754:" \
  --head-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

When a PR is already known, pass the concrete identity:

```bash
amplifier-bundle/tools/workflow_pr_scope.sh \
  --repo rysweet/amplihack-rs \
  --pr-number 812 \
  --pr-url https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/pull/812 \
  --head feat/issue-754-scoped-closure \
  --base main \
  --created-after 2026-06-12T03:52:44Z \
  --issue 754
```

Rules:

1. `--repo`, `--head`, and `--base` form the **primary key**. Combined with the
   same-repository / non-cross-repository guard, they are exact-match fields.
2. `--pr-number` and `--pr-url` are an authoritative override: when supplied they
   identify the PR directly and short-circuit the primary-key and tie-breaker
   passes. They must identify the same repository and PR.
3. When the primary key returns exactly one candidate, the helper returns it
   without consulting any tie-breaker.
4. `--issue`, `--work-item`, `--expected-pr-title-prefix`, `--created-after`, and
   `--head-sha` are **tie-breakers**. They are consulted only when the primary
   key returns more than one candidate. `--expected-pr-title-prefix` is a prefix
   check; `--issue` and `--work-item` match structured closing/reference fields
   or exact workflow metadata (never a broad text grep); `--head-sha` compares
   the PR head SHA; `--created-after` rejects candidates created before the run.
5. A stale or mismatched tie-breaker never rejects the sole primary-key
   candidate. When tie-breakers eliminate every candidate but exactly one OPEN
   candidate exists, that OPEN candidate is returned. OPEN candidates are
   preferred over closed candidates at every step.
6. The PR base repository and head repository must match `--repo` by default;
   fork and cross-repository PRs are rejected during the primary-key pass.
7. A PR on a different head branch is never matched. Zero primary-key candidates
   exit non-zero with `no_scoped_pr`; two or more OPEN candidates that survive
   tie-breaking exit non-zero with `multiple_scoped_prs`.
8. The helper never falls back to `gh pr list --author @me`, recent PR ordering,
   or broad title/body grep.

## PR Scope Result Schema

Successful validation prints JSON on stdout and exits `0`:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "scoped": true,
  "number": 812,
  "url": "https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/pull/812",
  "headRefName": "feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
  "baseRefName": "main",
  "headRefOid": "6c8e3b2a4f2e55d0fb65d51d94d8f4c16f37a111",
  "createdAt": "2026-06-12T04:03:19Z"
}
```

Invalid validation prints JSON and exits non-zero:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "reason": "no_scoped_pr",
  "message": "no PR matched the explicit workflow scope"
}
```

The `reason` value is stable and intended for recipes, shell tests, and monitor
checks. Human-readable `message` text is diagnostic only.

## PR Scope Resolution Passes

`workflow_pr_scope.sh` resolves the current-work PR through ordered passes. The
first pass that produces a single result wins.

| Pass | Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authoritative override | `--pr-number` or `--pr-url` supplied | Inspect that exact PR. Return it on match; fail closed on mismatch. Skips the remaining passes. |
| Primary key | No authoritative override | Filter to `headRefName == --head AND baseRefName == --base AND isCrossRepository == false AND owner/name == --repo`. |
| Single primary-key candidate | Primary key returns exactly one | Return it as `ok: true`. No tie-breaker is consulted. |
| Tie-breakers | Primary key returns two or more | Apply `--issue`, `--work-item`, `--expected-pr-title-prefix`, `--created-after`, `--head-sha`, preferring OPEN over closed. |
| Single-OPEN fallback | Tie-breakers eliminate all, one OPEN remains | Return that OPEN candidate rather than `no_scoped_pr`. |
| Loud ambiguity | Two or more OPEN candidates survive | Exit non-zero with `multiple_scoped_prs`. |
| Empty | Primary key returns zero | Exit non-zero with `no_scoped_pr`. |

Safety invariants that hold across all passes:

- A PR on a different `headRefName` is never matched.
- `isCrossRepository == true` and fork PRs are rejected in the primary-key pass.
- The head/base equality check is part of the primary key, never a tie-breaker.
- All GitHub stderr is routed through URL-credential redaction and length-capped
  before it appears in any diagnostic output.

`WorkstreamState` persists logical workflow scope and concrete process scope.
Missing fields deserialize successfully so old state files remain readable.

```json
{
  "workstream_id": "issue-754-closure",
  "status": "running",
  "scope": {
    "repository": "rysweet/amplihack-rs",
    "repo_path": "/home/user/src/amplihack-rs",
    "workdir": "/home/user/src/amplihack-rs/worktrees/feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "branch": "feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "base_ref": "main",
    "issue_number": 754,
    "work_item_id": null,
    "recipe_run_id": "run-01JZ7G7R4Z8KX8F2M9S5YH1VKT",
    "tree_id": "tree-01JZ7G7R5A7W1JYQXP3CBB2C2E",
    "workstream_id": "issue-754-closure",
    "started_at": "2026-06-12T03:52:44Z"
  },
  "process_scope": {
    "pid": 41872,
    "process_started_at": "2026-06-12T03:52:47Z",
    "process_start_marker": "41872:74293011",
    "captured_at": "2026-06-12T03:52:48Z"
  },
  "process_scope": {
    "pid": 41872,
    "repository": "rysweet/amplihack-rs",
    "repo_root": "/home/user/src/amplihack-rs/worktrees/feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "workdir": "/home/user/src/amplihack-rs/worktrees/feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "branch": "feat/issue-754-scoped-closure",
    "issue_id": "754",
    "work_item_id": "754",
    "recipe_run_id": "tree-01JZ7G7R5A7W1JYQXP3CBB2C2E",
    "tree_id": "tree-01JZ7G7R5A7W1JYQXP3CBB2C2E",
    "workstream_id": "ws-754",
    "process_started_at": "74293011",
    "recorded_at": "2026-06-12T04:03:24Z"
  }
}
```

Legacy state with missing `scope` or `process_scope` is valid for display. It is
not valid for notifications, closure, readiness, or terminal status decisions.

## Process Scope API

The multitask monitor validates process ownership through
`process_scope.rs`.

```rust
pub struct CurrentWorkflowScope {
    pub repository: String,
    pub repo_root: String,
    pub workdir: String,
    pub branch: String,
    pub issue_id: String,
    pub work_item_id: String,
    pub recipe_run_id: String,
    pub tree_id: String,
    pub workstream_id: String,
}

pub struct ProcessScope {
    pub pid: Option<u32>,
    pub repository: String,
    pub repo_root: String,
    pub workdir: String,
    pub branch: String,
    pub issue_id: String,
    pub work_item_id: String,
    pub recipe_run_id: String,
    pub tree_id: String,
    pub workstream_id: String,
    pub process_started_at: String,
    pub recorded_at: String,
}

pub struct ProcessSnapshot {
    pub pid: u32,
    pub alive: bool,
    pub workdir: String,
    pub process_started_at: String,
}

pub struct ProcessScopeConfig {
    pub max_age_seconds: i64,
}

pub enum ProcessScopeValidation {
    Valid,
    MissingScope,
    Dead,
    PidReused,
    TooOld,
    RepoMismatch,
    WorkdirMismatch,
    BranchMismatch,
    WorkstreamMismatch,
}

pub fn validate_process_scope(
    current: &CurrentWorkflowScope,
    persisted_workstream: &WorkstreamScope,
    persisted_process: &ProcessScope,
    snapshot: &ProcessSnapshot,
    config: &ProcessScopeConfig,
) -> ProcessScopeValidation;
```

All path comparisons use canonical paths when the paths exist. If canonical
resolution fails for a required path, validation returns the corresponding
mismatch instead of guessing.

## Process Validation Outcomes

Rust enum names are internal. CLI and JSON output serializes validation reasons
as snake_case.

| Rust outcome | Serialized reason | Authoritative | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Valid` | `valid` | Yes | Persisted state, current workflow scope, and runtime snapshot match. |
| `MissingScope` | `missing_scope` | No | Old state lacks required scope fields. |
| `Dead` | `dead` | No | PID is not running. |
| `PidReused` | `pid_reused` | No | PID exists, but runtime start metadata differs from the launch record. |
| `TooOld` | `too_old` | No | Process age exceeds `ProcessScopeConfig::max_age_seconds`. |
| `RepoMismatch` | `repo_mismatch` | No | Persisted repository or repo path differs from current workflow. |
| `WorkdirMismatch` | `workdir_mismatch` | No | Persisted workdir differs from current workflow workdir. |
| `BranchMismatch` | `branch_mismatch` | No | Persisted branch differs from current branch. |
| `WorkstreamMismatch` | `workstream_mismatch` | No | Recipe run, tree id, or workstream id differs. |

Only `valid` permits monitor notifications or closure behavior.

## Recipe Integration Contract

These bundled tools and recipes use scoped validation:

| Component | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_publish_pr.sh` | Persists PR identity after creation and validates known PR identity before updating an existing PR. On `gh pr create` collision, re-runs the scoped lookup and adopts an existing OPEN PR as `existing-open-pr` success instead of failing the recipe. |
| `workflow_pr_ready.sh` | Refuses readiness checks until `workflow_pr_scope.sh` returns `ok: true`. |
| `workflow_final_status.sh` | Requires validated PR metadata before reporting terminal PR status. |
| `workflow-terminal-state.yaml` | Uses persisted PR URL or number, then scoped lookup; no recent-PR fallback. |
| `workflow-tdd.yaml` | Carries repository, head branch, base branch, tracking item, recipe run, and start-time scope through test and closure steps. |
| `quality-loop.yaml` | May survey broad PRs for quality reporting, but those surveys are not current-work identity. |
| multitask launcher | Captures workstream and process scope at process launch. |
| multitask orchestrator | Emits notifications and closure decisions only for serialized `valid` process scope. |

## Failure Semantics

Scoped closure fails closed, but a stale tracking discriminator is not a
failure:

- missing primary-key scope (repository, head, base) blocks
  publish/readiness/final-status current-work claims
- unrelated PRs are ignored even when newer or authored by the same account
- a PR on a different head branch is never adopted
- cross-repository and fork PRs are rejected by default
- two or more OPEN candidates on the same head and base block with
  `multiple_scoped_prs` until scope is made more specific
- a stale `issue_number` or `head_sha` does **not** reject the unique
  primary-key PR; those fields only break ties among multiple candidates
- `no_scoped_pr` is reserved for a genuinely empty primary-key result
- stale process records are display-only
- PID reuse is rejected when runtime start metadata differs
- missing runtime start metadata is rejected as incomplete process scope
- exact-head readiness blocks when `head_sha` differs from PR head

Failure output names the invalid reason and the checked identifiers. It does
not persist secrets, full environment dumps, auth headers, agent prompts, or
full process command lines.

## Deterministic Checks

The regression suite covers these contracts:

```bash
cargo test -p amplihack-cli --test issue_754_scoped_monitor_contracts
cargo test -p amplihack-cli --test pr_scope_primary_key_test

amplifier-bundle/recipes/tests/test-default-workflow-reliability.sh \
  scoped-pr-identity
```

Representative checks:

| Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| unique branch/base PR with a stale `--issue` and `--head-sha` | helper adopts it with `ok: true` |
| PR body references a different upstream issue than the branch tracking issue | helper still adopts it (`ok: true`) |
| newer unrelated PR exists for same author | scoped helper rejects it |
| PR on a different head branch | helper never matches it |
| zero primary-key candidates | helper exits non-zero with `no_scoped_pr` |
| two or more OPEN candidates on the same head and base | helper exits non-zero with `multiple_scoped_prs` |
| fork or cross-repository PR candidate | helper rejects it during the primary-key pass |
| `gh pr create` collides with an existing OPEN PR | publish returns `existing-open-pr` success (exit 0), not `FAILED_PR_CREATE` |
| persisted legacy workstream lacks scope | monitor marks display-only and does not notify |
| persisted PID is dead | validation returns `dead` |
| PID exists with different start marker | validation returns `pid_reused` |
| process start metadata is missing | validation returns `missing_scope` |
| repo, workdir, branch, recipe, tracking item, or workstream differs | validation returns the named mismatch |
