# Copy-Ready Templates

These match the repo's ACTUAL recipe shape (see `amplifier-bundle/recipes/
default-workflow.yaml` and `smart-classify-route.yaml`). Each protection is annotated
with its "why" so copiers do not strip it as boilerplate. Use `{{placeholders}}` —
never hardcode host-specific paths.

## Template A — Recipe skeleton (agentic step → tool writes typed record → thin-rail read)

```yaml
name: "{{workflow_name}}"
description: "{{one-line goal}}"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "{{author}}"
tags: ["{{tag}}"]

# NO-TIMEOUT POLICY: no per-step wall-clock `timeout:` on agent steps (AP-3).
# Idle/liveness detection guards agentic steps; shell `timeout` only guards
# external network commands inside bash steps.

recursion:
  max_depth: 6
  max_total_steps: 80

context:
  # Small, non-secret inputs only (AP-4: no large payloads via env/argv).
  repo_path: "."
  input_ref: ""          # path/id to a file the steps read; not the payload itself
  record_path: ""        # where the typed record is written/read

steps:
  # (a) AGENTIC STEP — judgment behind a prompt (Step 3a)
  - id: "decide"
    type: "agent"
    agent: "amplihack:core:architect"
    prompt: |
      === [RECIPE PROGRESS] Step: decide ===
      {{See Template B for the prompt body}}
      Emit ONLY the typed record described in Template C. Do not print prose.
    output: "decision_record"

  # (b) TOOL STEP — deterministic side effect: write the typed record 0o600 (AP-1)
  - id: "persist-record"
    type: "bash"
    command: |
      set -euo pipefail
      REC="${RECORD_PATH:?record_path required}"
      # WHY 0o600 at creation (not chmod-after): closes the TOCTOU window (AP-1).
      ( umask 177; : > "$REC" )          # create owner-only, atomically empty
      # WHY here-doc/stdin, not argv: avoids E2BIG + /proc leak (AP-4).
      cat > "$REC" <<'RECORD'
      {{typed record JSON — see Template C}}
      RECORD
    output: "record_written"

  # (c) THIN RAIL — read the record fail-CLOSED, then route (Step 3c / Template D)
  - id: "route"
    type: "bash"
    command: |
      set -euo pipefail
      "{{repo_path}}/scripts/read_record.sh" "${RECORD_PATH:?}"   # fail-closed reader
    output: "route_result"
```

## Template B — Inline prompt skeleton

The repo's canonical prompt shape is an **inline `prompt: |` block** inside the recipe
step (as in `smart-classify-route.yaml`). There is no separate `prompts/*.yaml` asset
format in this repo; keep prompts inline.

```yaml
    prompt: |
      === [RECIPE PROGRESS] Step: {{step_id}} ===

      You are performing ONE judgment step. Do NOT implement, build, or run tools.

      **INPUT**: {{input_ref}} (read the file at this path; it is not inlined here — AP-4)

      **TASK**: {{state the single decision — classify / prioritize / interpret}}

      **CLASSES / RULES**:
      - {{class or rule 1}}
      - {{class or rule 2}}

      **OUTPUT**: Emit ONLY a typed record matching this schema (no prose, no fences):
      {{Template C schema}}
```

> Aside: Simard sometimes stores prompts as separate asset files
> (`operator-liaison.yaml`, `merge-readiness-judge.yaml`). That variant is fine there,
> but this repo verifies only the inline form — use inline here.

## Template C — Typed-record schema

```json
{
  "schema": "{{workflow_name}}.decision",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "nonce": "{{run-unique nonce — freshness/replay guard, AP-1}}",
  "created_at": "{{RFC3339 timestamp}}",
  "decision": "{{one of the enumerated classes}}",
  "confidence": "{{low|medium|high}}",
  "rationale": "{{short, for observability only — never parsed for control flow}}"
}
```

Control flow reads ONLY typed fields (`decision`, `schema_version`, `nonce`). `rationale`
is human-facing and must never drive routing (that would re-introduce AP-1).

## Template D — Fail-CLOSED reader (`scripts/read_record.sh`, the thin rail)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Thin rail: read a typed record fail-CLOSED. Aborts on ANY doubt (AP-1).
set -euo pipefail
REC="${1:?record path required}"

# WHY each guard: any failure => abort the step; never proceed on default data.
[ -f "$REC" ]                        || { echo "record missing: $REC" >&2; exit 1; }
perms=$(stat -c '%a' "$REC" 2>/dev/null || stat -f '%Lp' "$REC")  # GNU || BSD/macOS
[ "$perms" = "600" ]                 || { echo "record not 0o600 (got $perms)" >&2; exit 1; }
jq -e . "$REC" >/dev/null            || { echo "record not valid JSON" >&2; exit 1; }
ver=$(jq -r '.schema_version' "$REC")
[ "$ver" = "1" ]                     || { echo "unexpected schema_version: $ver" >&2; exit 1; }
[ "$(jq -r '.nonce' "$REC")" = "${EXPECTED_NONCE:?}" ] \
                                     || { echo "stale/replayed record (nonce mismatch)" >&2; exit 1; }

decision=$(jq -r '.decision' "$REC")   # route ONLY on the typed field
# Optional allowlist (defense-in-depth): when ALLOWED_DECISIONS is set (space-separated),
# reject any decision outside it — fail CLOSED here, before the caller ever routes on it.
if [ -n "${ALLOWED_DECISIONS:-}" ]; then
  case " $ALLOWED_DECISIONS " in
    *" $decision "*) : ;;
    *) echo "decision not in allowlist: $decision" >&2; exit 1 ;;
  esac
fi
echo "$decision"
```

**PR-review checklist (paste into the PR):**
- [ ] No example shows a fail-OPEN handoff (proceeding on missing/partial record).
- [ ] No example uses `chmod` after write (must be `0o600` at creation).
- [ ] No large/sensitive payload passed via argv or env (stdin/file only).
- [ ] No control flow keys off `rationale`/free-text (only typed fields).
