# Terminal-state evidence collector and adjudicator (issue #1268).
#
# `workflow_pr_scope.sh` answers a genuinely semantic question — "is this the PR
# this workflow was supposed to produce?" — with string matching over head/base
# refs. When it misses, `workflow_final_status.sh` used to exit non-zero and the
# whole run was reported as a failure. That happened AFTER a PR had been
# created, reviewed, quality-audited and merged: the run's real deliverable was
# in `main`, and two follow-up PRs it had opened were abandoned, one rotting
# into a conflicted state with nobody to rebase it. The gate meant to prove
# success destroyed it instead.
#
# The scope match stays as a cheap SIGNAL. It is no longer the arbiter. When it
# misses, this helper looks at what actually happened — is there a PR, did it
# merge, is the work in the base branch — and renders one of three verdicts:
#
#   SUCCESS    the work demonstrably landed or a live PR carries it  -> exit 0
#   UNCERTAIN  the evidence could not be read; nothing is claimed and
#              every outstanding artifact is enumerated for the caller -> exit 0
#   FAILED     the evidence WAS readable and shows the work did not
#              land and no PR carries it                              -> exit 1
#
# It is deliberately not a rubber stamp. `hard_negative` marks the case where
# the evidence positively shows failure; in that state no agent judgement, and
# no caller-supplied verdict, can lift the verdict to SUCCESS. And a SUCCESS
# asserted from outside is admitted ONLY when the collected evidence carries at
# least one positive artifact fact (a merged PR, an open PR, or work already in
# base). Judgement can always DOWNGRADE — that direction is never dangerous.
#
# Usage:
#   workflow_terminal_evidence.sh collect [--repo O/R] [--head REF] [--base REF]
#       [--head-sha SHA] [--pr-url URL] [--pr-number N] [--created-after TIME]
#   workflow_terminal_evidence.sh collect-for-step        (recipe wrapper for collect)
#   workflow_terminal_evidence.sh verdict-token          (recipe wrapper: prose -> token)
#   workflow_terminal_evidence.sh adjudicate [--evidence JSON | --evidence-file F | -]
#       [--agent-verdict TOKEN] [--scope-reason REASON] [--report-only]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  SUCCESS or UNCERTAIN (adjudicate); evidence emitted (collect)
#   1  FAILED (adjudicate)
#   2  usage error or missing required tooling

# Deliberately no `-e`: this helper must always terminate with a structured
# answer on stdout rather than dying mid-probe and leaving the caller guessing.
